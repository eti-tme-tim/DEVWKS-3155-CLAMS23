# Learning Lab 2.0 Orientation

This section is all about orientation to the learning lab environment you are now operating within.  The important concepts to review are:

- Content pane (on the left)
- Editor pane (upper right)
  - directory tree
  - refresh icon, necessary after CLI directory/file changes
  - keystrokes are autosaved
- Terminal pane (lower right)

## Features to Note

You don't have to cut and paste to run commands!

```bash
echo "Hello World"
```

Text that will be used for copying into the editor will show up in it's own code box.

```
This is only a test
```

## Behind the curtain

This workshop web page, editor, and terminal are containerized applications running in the DevNet cloud. Commands and files you create are running elsewhere and do not depend on your laptop, software dependencies, etc.
